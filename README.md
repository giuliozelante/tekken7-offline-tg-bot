## 📍 Overview

The core functionality of the project is to provide a Telegram bot called "MeetUp" for managing and scheduling meetups in a group. The bot can start and stop meetups, provide help messages, and validate admin privileges. It integrates with a database and uses the Micronaut framework and Telegram Bots API. The project's purpose is to facilitate the coordination of offline tournaments and events, bringing value by automating the process and making it more efficient for group members.

| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **⚙️ Architecture**     | The system follows the Micronaut application architecture, providing a modular and scalable design. It leverages the Telegram Bots API for bot functionality and employs the Micronaut data framework for data handling and serialization. The codebase has a layered architecture consisting of the application layer (App.java) and bot functionality layer (MeetUp.java), which allows for separation of concerns and easy extensibility. |
| **📖 Documentation**    | The codebase lacks extensive documentation. While some comments are present, there is no formal documentation explaining the overall architecture, design decisions, or usage instructions. Enhancing the documentation would improve the codebase's maintainability and ease of collaboration.                                                                                                           |
| **🔗 Dependencies**    | The system relies on Micronaut, a lightweight Java framework, for dependency injection, web functionality, and data handling. It also uses the Telegram Bots API for bot interactions. The Gradle build tool manages the project's dependencies and plugins effectively.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **🧩 Modularity**      | The codebase demonstrates modularity by separating concerns into relevant packages and classes. Modules such as the bot functionality module, repository module, service module, and entity module facilitate maintainability, extensibility, and ease of debugging. However, cross-cutting concerns such as logging and error handling could be better modularized and encapsulated for improved code maintainability and testability.    |
| **✔️ Testing**         | There is limited evidence of testing in the codebase. Inadequate unit testing can hinder robustness and maintainability. A thorough testing strategy involving unit tests, integration tests, and possibly end-to-end tests would enhance the reliability of the system and prevent regressions. A suitable Java testing framework such as JUnit or TestNG is recommended.                                                                                      |
| **⚡️ Performance**     | The codebase leverages AOT compilation configurations to optimize runtime performance. Additionally, it uses Micronaut, which provides efficient dependency injection and reduces boilerplate code. However, without performance benchmarks or profiling, it is challenging to provide a precise performance evaluation. Consistent monitoring and optimization are recommended for real-life performance assessment.      |
| **🔐 Security**        | The codebase lacks explicit security measures, such as user authentication or authorization checks. As the Telegram Bots API handles communication, it's crucial to ensure that sensitive operations are secured and validated on the server-side. Measures like parameter validation, access control checks, and encryption of sensitive data are essential for maintaining the system's security.                                                 |
| **🔀 Version Control** | The codebase uses Git for version control management and is hosted on GitHub. Leveraging Git in conjunction with GitHub facilitates collaboration, issue tracking, and team coordination. Encouraging code reviews and following Git best practices, like using branches and commit conventions, would further enhance version control and team collaboration.                                                                                          |
| **🔌 Integrations**    | The system integrates with the Telegram Bots API, enabling interaction with Telegram user groups. The Micronaut framework seamlessly handles the integration with the Telegram Bots API and provides a
